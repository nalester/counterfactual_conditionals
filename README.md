# Counterfactual conditionals in the world ºs languages

This project examines the behavior of **counterfactual-conditional constructions** across a large, **geographically and genetically balanced** sample of languages. 

This repository contains the **quantitative analyses** of that sample: CART, random forests, and contingency (using the Distinctive Collexeme Analysis package provided by Stefan Th. Gries, available here: http://www.stgries.info/teaching/groningen/index.html). 

## Data are avaialble by request.
